This is the game Blackjack! There is no splitting hands or doubling down. Other than that it is normal blackjack rules. Each player is dealt 2 cards to start, computer/dealer has one face down until their turn. Player will go first and hit (get another card) until they either stay or are over 21. After that, it is the computers turn. The winner is decided by getting blackjack (one jack and one ace) or whoever has the higher number at or under 21.
